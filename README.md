# Narrative Oxford Plan

This is the long-term writing and research archive by Tsuki, a critical care nurse, writer, and health system reform advocate from Taiwan.

This repository documents the process of:
- Writing letters to Gary Vee about my dream to pursue a DPhil at Oxford.
- Composing narrative medicine articles based on clinical stories.
- Drafting proposals to reform Taiwan’s health insurance system.
- Recording every thought, pain, and breakthrough along the journey.

I believe stories can become policy, and care can become a system.
